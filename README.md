# Library Management System


## Overview 

This project is my week 1 practical application assignment from my promotion/improvement plan.  I have decided to do a library management system given that I own a lot of tech books and have plenty of domain knowledge to draw from.

As a brief background, I used ChatGPT to come up with a 20-week promotion/improvement plan.  Every week, there is a capstone project which covers everything learned or reviewed that week, and this is the capstone project for week 1.   The improvement plan may be [found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1khvd-Hnr2aloLgFFNf_-HvQcC3RJbUHeoJ2zemckrlA/edit?pli=1).


## Assignment

Combine your learning to work on a larger coding project that incorporates the concepts from the week, such as building a simple library management system or a basic e-commerce platform.

This project is in Java since this week was spent reviewing fundamental Java concepts.


## Concepts to Cover

These are the concepts I reviewed/utilized from week 1 that this project needs to cover.

- OOP principles - encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction, inheritance
- objects, classes, and instances
